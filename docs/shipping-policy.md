# Lure Shipping Policy

**Last Updated:** June 24, 2025

At Lure, we are committed to providing you with a seamless shopping experience and delivering your favorite clothing items efficiently. Our unique cross-docking logistics model ensures your products reach you as quickly as possible from their origin.

---

## 1. Order Processing Time

Once you place an order, our team requires **[Number] business days** to process and prepare your items for shipment. This includes order verification, quality check, and packaging in Brazil before they begin their journey.

- **Example:** "1-3 business days"

---

## 2. Our Cross-Docking Model & International Shipping

Lure operates on a sophisticated **cross-docking fulfillment model**. This means your products are consolidated and shipped from Brazil directly to a specialized cross-dock facility in the United States. Upon arrival in the U.S., your shipment is quickly deconsolidated (broken down into individual customer orders) and immediately transferred to local delivery carriers **without being stored in a traditional warehouse**. This strategic approach minimizes storage costs and accelerates the final delivery to your doorstep.

---

## 3. Estimated Delivery Times

Given our international shipping and cross-docking process, our estimated delivery times are as follows:

- **Standard Shipping:** **[Number] to [Number] business days** from the date your order is placed.
    - **Example:** "7 to 15 business days"
- Please note that these are estimated delivery times. While we strive to meet these timeframes, actual delivery times may vary due to factors beyond our control, such as customs processing, carrier delays, or unforeseen logistical challenges.

## 4. Shipping Costs

Shipping costs are calculated based on your order value and chosen shipping method. You will see the exact shipping cost displayed at checkout before you complete your purchase.

- **Free Shipping:** We may offer free standard shipping on orders exceeding a certain value, as indicated on our website during promotional periods.

---

## 5. Order Tracking

Once your order has been shipped from our cross-dock facility in the U.S., you will receive a shipping confirmation email containing a tracking number. You can use this tracking number to monitor the progress of your delivery directly on the carrier's website.

- Please allow up to **[Number] business days** for the tracking information to become active after you receive your shipping confirmation.

---

## 6. Customs Duties, Taxes, and Import Fees

As your products are shipped internationally from Brazil to the United States, your order may be subject to import duties, taxes, and customs fees levied by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

- **Customers are responsible for all applicable import duties, taxes, and customs fees.** These charges are typically collected by the shipping carrier upon delivery and are not included in your order total or shipping cost.
- We advise customers to contact their local customs office for current charges before placing an order to avoid unexpected fees. Lure is unable to provide estimates for these charges.

---

## 7. Incorrect Shipping Addresses

It is the customer's responsibility to provide an accurate and complete shipping address at the time of purchase. Lure is not responsible for orders delivered to incorrect addresses provided by the customer.

- If an order is returned to us due to an incorrect address, you may be responsible for re-shipping fees.
- If you realize you've made an error in your shipping address, please contact us immediately at **contact@lureclo.com**. We will do our best to correct it before the order is shipped, but changes are not guaranteed once processing begins.

## 8. Lost or Damaged Packages

In the rare event that your package is lost in transit or arrives damaged, please contact us at **contact@lureclo.com** within **[Number] days** of the expected delivery date for lost packages or within **[Number] days** of delivery for damaged packages.
