You are an expert in web development and Google Analytics 4 (GA4) implementation. Your task is to integrate GA4 tracking into an existing e-commerce website built with a custom front-end framework.

I have provided you with access to the entire front-end codebase, including all page templates and JavaScript files, as well as the database models/schemas (to understand data structures like product details, order information, user data).

Your goal is to implement two main phases of GA4 tracking:

### Phase 1: Global GA4 Tag Installation

1.  **Objective:** Insert the GA4 global site tag (`gtag.js`) into all relevant pages of the e-commerce website.
2.  **Specifics:**
    * The tag must be placed as high as possible within the `<head>` section of **every single page** of the website.
    * Use the GA4 Measurement ID: `G-XXXXXXXXX` (replace with the actual ID after creating the property in Google Analytics).
    * Ensure the tag loads asynchronously without blocking page rendering.
3.  **Output:** Provide the exact code snippets to be inserted and specify the file paths/locations where they should be placed for each of the following pages:
    * Home Page
    * Product Page
    * Cart
    * Checkout
